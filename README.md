# TF-IDF
Program 1 for CS 5322 Introduction to Natural Language Processing

This program creates a TF-IDF representation of a NLTK corpus object. Term frequency can be calculated using raw term frequency or log normalized frequency, and inverse document frequency can be calculated using basic inverse frequency or inverse frequency smoothed. A cosine similarity between documents in an NLTK corpus can also be calculated. The program can also execute simple queries that calculates the cosine similarity between the given query and all of the documents in the given corpus object.
